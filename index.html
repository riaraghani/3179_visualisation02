                <p>Today, more people than ever live in a country other than the one in which they were born. According
                    to the IOM World Migration Report 2020, as of June 2019 the number of international migrants was
                    estimated to be almost 272 million globally.
                    With this continuous increase, it is important to explore and understand what it is like to live in
                    different parts of the world. This webpage explores the different parameters one must consider when
                    deciding to migrate to another country.</p>

                Quality of Life refers to the level of wealth, comfort, necessities, physical and mental health and
                wellness, and material goods available to a particular geographic area.
                <br>As we move the year slider, we can see how the quality of life index increases showing a significant
                rise in the standard of living across various countries.

            Health Care Index
        </h2>
        <p>Health Care Index is a statistical analysis of the overall quality of the health care system, including
            health care infrastructure; health care professionals (doctors, nursing staff, and other health workers)
            competencies; cost; quality medicine availability, and government readiness. It is
            expected that for countries with higher health care index will have a higher life expectancy. This trend
            is
            seen in the bubble chart that compares the health care index for various countries in different
            continents,
            with the average life expectancy for that country. <span style="font-size: large;font-weight: bold;">Japan, South Korea, Taiwan</span> are the top 3 countries

            <h2>Is world becoming more or less safe?</h2>
        
        The radial chart shows the safety index for some of the most developed (and presumed to be
        “safe”)
        countries. Qatar and UAE have the highest safety index among other countries. On the other hand, countries
        like
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #7bb5ae;">Australia</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #330ea1;">United Kingdom</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; color:#142a69;">United Staes of America</span> (that usually have more migrations) are comparatively
        less
        safe.
        There are some commonalities among the safest countries in the world. For instance, safe countries tend to
        display
        high
        levels of wealth, social welfare, effective
        criminal
        justice
        systems, and education.</p style="float:left;">

            Happiness Index

        <p>How happy are people today? Were people happier in the past? How satisfied with their lives are people in
            different societies? These are some difficult questions to answer. The World Happiness report is a
            well-known source of cross-country data and research on which countries have the highest happiness index.
            From the bump chart, we can see the happiness index ranks for the top 10 countries from 2015 to 2021.
            Finland continues to be the country with the highest happiness index for four consecutive years. Other
            European countries like Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland and Netherlands are among the top 5 countries with
            high happiness index.</div>

        <h2>Unemployment Rate</h2>
        Unemployment has many adverse effects, including: increased depression and other mental health problems,
        increased crime rates, overall lower economic productivity and consumption, lower rates of volunteerism, and
        erosion of skills. This can lead to a rising cost of living, which can be particularly hard on
        citizens in developing and/or low-income countries. The area chart displays the unemployment rates for some of
        the most developed countries. The 2008 recession effect can be seen on almost all countries. A clear effect of
        the covid 19 pandemic can also be seen around 2020-2021.</p style="float:left;">

            food, shelter, transportation, energy, clothing, education, healthcare, childcare, and entertainment in

            followed by Iceland, Japan and Australia for the year 2021.
